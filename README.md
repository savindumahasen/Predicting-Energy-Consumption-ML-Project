# Energy Consuming Prediction - (ML Project)
This project is mainly based on regression analysis. Mian aim of this project is  identify how much energy is consuming (Energy Consumption - target variable) by pepole based on the various independent factors like 'Building Type', 'Square Footage', 'Number of Occupants', 'Appliances Used', 'Average Temperature', 'Day of Week'. This project includes  deeply  EDA (Explotary Data Analysis),data preprocessing, and model evaluvation. For explaning the EDA and model evaluvation purpose, use the various kind of plots like scatterplot, displot and  regression plots etc. For developing this project mainly use LinearRegression model, python, github and VS CodeIDE.
